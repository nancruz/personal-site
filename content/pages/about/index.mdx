Hi,

I'm Nuno and I'm a Frontend Engineer working at [Sky Uk](https://www.sky.com).

With more than 5+ years of experience building products with JavaScript, I'm currently helping my team building [Peacock](https://www.peacocktv.com) 🦚 - the best streaming platform.


Previously, I spent 4 years at [Feezai](https://feedzai.com) helping building fraud prevention tools to help fraud investigators and analysts to find and visualize complex financial crime patterns tools using technologies like React, D3.js or canvas.

When not building stuff, I'm probably at the gym 🏋️‍♂️, running 🏃‍♂, reading 📖 or taking photos 📸.

For more information about my professional experience, please check my [resume](/resume.pdf).
