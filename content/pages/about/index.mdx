Hi,

I'm Nuno and I'm a Frontend Engineer working at [Feedzai](www.feedzai.com).

With more than 5+ years of experience building products with JavaScript, I'm now currently helping my team building a data visualization tool - using React, D3.js and canvas - to help fraud investigators and analysts to find and visualize complex financial crime patterns using link analysis graph technology.

When not building stuff, I'm probably at the gym 🏋️‍♂️, running 🏃‍♂, reading 📖 or taking photos 📸.

For more information about my professional experience, please check my [resume](/resume.pdf).
